h2. Presentation Theme

p. When I was holding presentations with some Eclipse install, sometimes there was a need to use bigger fonts, but that involved quite a tedious work in the user interface. The situation is even worse, if I happen to demo using my main workspace.

p. This is why I am proposing this new Eclipse theme, that tries to address this need by adding a single, non-rewriting option to the Eclipse preferences to change the theme.

p. For a longer introduction and screenshots, visit the announcement blog post at http://cubussapiens.hu/2010/10/presentation-theme-for-eclipse/ You can also download the software from our update site: http://eclipse.cubussapiens.hu

h3. Usage 

p. Open the _Preferences_ page, select  _General/Appeareance_, then at the middle of the screen select the _Current theme_ as *Presentation theme*. Enjoy.

p. If you are done with the presentation, simply switch back to the theme you were using.
